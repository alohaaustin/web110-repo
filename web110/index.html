       <p>Hi my name is Dve Austin Lopez. I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. Moved to Seattle, Washington in the year of 2014 to experience 4 seasons and because i felt like i was trap in a small island. So far I love living in Seattle because of how diverse and more opened minded the people are here and the enviorment like the city buildings, greenery, and mountains is beautiful. I also like that im able to drive to other states if i wanted to change scenery.</p>
           
      <p>In my past life i was a certified auto technician for about 2 years and then got a better job offer and became a certified diesel technician for 5 years. Body started giving out and getting sick more consistent so i ended up switching careers and happy that i did that before anything worse happens.</p>
       
       <h3>Sub Header</h3>

       <p>My intrest and hobbies are collecting vynyl records that i enjoy listening to, import cars, playing online video games on my pc, upgrading parts on my desktop, hiking and camping with my partner, traveling, sailing, taking my dog to the park, waching musicals, playing the ukulele and piano, shopping for furniture and accesories to design my apartment, and i also love shopping for diffrent types of clothes.</p>

       <p> The type of web development I'm mostly leaning toward more the design aspect of it, because I love designing and the creative part of things but still enjoy the programming part of it so i wouldn't be opposed to going into the project management or programmer side of web development.</p>
